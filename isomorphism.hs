-- A type of `Void` has no value.
-- So it is impossible to construct `Void`,

-- And there is a function
-- absurd :: Void -> a
-- That can get any value out of `Void`
-- We can do this because we can never have void in the zeroth place.

-- so, when are two types, `a` and `b`, considered equal?
-- a definition might be, it is possible to go from `a` to `b`,
-- and from `b` to `a`.
-- Going a roundway trip should leave you the same value.
-- Unfortunately it is virtually impossible to test this in Haskell.
-- This is called Isomorphism.
